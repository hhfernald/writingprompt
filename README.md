# WritingPrompt

*Current version: v0.2.*

**WritingPrompt** is a Python script intended to help a fiction writer dealing with writer's block. It generates random sentences intended to get the imagination working. Open a command line and run it, and it produces ten sentences like this:

-   I was to help the successful veterinarian in the tidy lab to capture
    the landrover.
-   Find the architect before she decides to invite him to a party.
-   Who was that prickly pest?
-   While exploring the infested pasture, the cultured commander heard
    the whirring of machinery.
-   What was that self-centered dancer doing in the ominous coffeehouse?
-   Find the astronaut before she decides to teach him a lesson.
-   I had to find that candid harbor master and protect him.
-   I was to help the self-centered demigod in the remote basement to
    seize the landrover.
-   The antisocial engineer wanted to find the drifter and offer her a
    contract.
-   The clumsy agent wanted to find the author and propose to her.

Each time you run the script, it will produce a different set of sentences.


## No installation

This has no installer; it's just a script. You can just download the archive file, extract its contents, navigate to the notepath folder, and run `writingprompt.py`. From the shell in Linux, you can do this:

    git clone https://github.com/hhfernald/writingprompt.git
    cd writingprompt
    chmod +x ./writingprompt.py

This software outputs text to standard output. You can use redirection to save the text to a file, like this:

    ./writingprompt.py >> prompts.txt



## Dependencies

-   Python. This will work under either Python 2.7 or Python 3.



## Free Open-Source Software

I wrote this application for no one but myself, but maybe its source code will be useful to someone else. I'm releasing this script under the MIT License. If you find anything useful in the code I've written, feel free to fork this project and build your own application.
